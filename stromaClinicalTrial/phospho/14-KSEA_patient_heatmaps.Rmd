### Metadata

```{r libraries and setup, include=FALSE}
library(amlresistancenetworks)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(readxl)
source("../../Util/synapseUtil.R")

# corrected for loading mass and plexID, long time and subtle
p.site.corrected <- querySynapseTable("syn26047149")

phos.dat <- p.site.corrected
phos.dat$Peptide <- sub("^.*@(.*)$", "\\1", phos.dat$Accession)
phos.dat$site <- sub("^(.*)@.*$", "\\1", phos.dat$Accession)
phos.dat$Gene <- sub("(.*)-.*$", "\\1", phos.dat$site)

## We have the metadata selected from the long form table
summary <- p.site.corrected[p.site.corrected$Accession == "AAK1-T606t@K.VQTT*PPPAVQGQK.V", 
                            c("Sample", "BeatAML Patient ID", 
                              "Plex", "Loading Mass", "Description", 
                              "Period", "Treatment")]

rownames(summary) <- summary$Sample

## Organizing time points into the right order (not alphanumeric)
time.points <- c("P2 Pre-Study", "P2 Cycle 1 Day 1", "P2 Cycle 1 Day 28", "P2 Cycle 2 Day 28", "P2 Cycle 3 Day 28", 
                 "P1B Cycle 1 Day 1", "P1B Cycle 1 Day 28", "P1B Cycle 2 Day 28", "P1B Cycle 3 Day 28", "P1B Cycle 6 Day 28",
                 "P1B Cycle 9 Day 28", "P1B Conc Cycle 9 Day 28") %>%
  factor(.)


summary$Description <- factor(summary$Description, levels = time.points)
summary <- summary[sort(summary$Sample), ]
summary$`BeatAML Patient ID` <- factor(summary$`BeatAML Patient ID`, levels = unique(summary$`BeatAML Patient ID`))
summary$Treatment <- make.names(summary$Treatment)

Below we show only the metadata for the 7 patients.

### KSEA Heatmaps Gilteritinib vs Pre-treatment
 
Six of the seven patients have both a Pre-treatment and Gilteritinib sample. From these 6 patients,
We have a total of 6 Pre-Treatment samples (one per patient), each with a single corresponding Gilteritinib sample, except
patient 5145, who has 2 Gilteritinib samples.

We use these 6 patients to run KSEA to compare the Pre-Treatment group to the Gilteritinib group on a per patient basis.
After collecting these enrichment results, we re-adjust 
the p-values using "BH" (Benjamini Hochberg) correction. We select only the top 50 most enriched
kinases and select those with an adjusted p-value below 0.05. 

In these plots, red indicates increased activity in the Gilteritinib, while blue shows increased
activity in the Pre-Treatment group. Moreover, the asterisk indicates an adjusted p-value below 0.05 for 
that particular patient + kinases.

We use the z-score for each kinase + patient combination in the heatmap.

```{r fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap=c("Phosphosite Plus & NetworKIN")}
knitr::include_graphics("Making Plots/Kinase heatmap Gilteritinib vs Pre-Treatment - Phosphosite Plus + NetworKIN.png")
```

### KSEA Heatmaps Gilteritinib + Decitabine vs Gilteritinib

Only three of the seven patients have a Gilteritinib + Decitabine sample, namely "5029", "5104" and "5174". 
Patients "5029" and "5104" both have one sample for each of the Gilteritinib and Gilteritinib + Decitabine groups, 
while "5104" has one Gilteritinib and 4 Gilteritinib + Decitabine sample.

We use these 3 patients to run KSEA to compare the Late period 
to the Early period for each patient. After collecting these enrichment results, we re-adjust 
the p-values using "BH" (Benjamini Hochberg) correction. We select only the top 50 most enriched
kinases and select those with an adjusted p-value below 0.05. 

In these plots, red indicates increased activity in the Gilteritinib + Decitabine group, while blue shows increased
activity in the Gilteritinib group. Moreover, the asterisk indicates an adjusted p-value below 0.05 for 
that particular patient + kinase.

We use the z-score for each kinase + patient combination in the heatmap.
