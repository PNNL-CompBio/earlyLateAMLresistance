## Introduction

We access synapse to load the data in long form. We use data which has been corrected for both
Loading mass effect, as well as plex effect. Below we see a metadata table for this experiment.

```{r metadata, echo=FALSE}
show <- summary
kbl(show) %>%
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = T)

```

```{r prepare groups and matrix, include=FALSE}
##select the samples of interest
healthy <- subset(summary, `BeatAML Patient ID` == 'Healthy Donor Stroma')

pre.treatment <- subset(summary, Period == "Pre-Treatment")

## Earliest sample, per patient, which has been treated with GILT
treated.gilt <- subset(summary, Treatment == "GILT") %>%
  filter(`BeatAML Patient ID` != "5029") %>%
  group_by(`BeatAML Patient ID`) %>%
  slice(1)

## Earliest sample, per patient, which has been treated with GILT + DEC
treated.gilt.and.dec <- subset(summary, Treatment == "GILT...DEC") %>%
  group_by(`BeatAML Patient ID`) %>%
  slice(1)

##then we spread the proteomics data into a matrix
colnames(prot.dat)[[1]] <- "Gene"
prot.mat <- prot.dat%>%
  select(LogRatio,Sample,Gene)%>%
  tidyr::pivot_wider(values_from='LogRatio',names_from='Sample',
                     values_fn=list(LogRatio=mean))%>%
  tibble::column_to_rownames('Gene')
```

In this report we collect both rank based GSEA for each stated comparison, as well the results of
Jason McDermott's correlation enrichment. 

Correlation enrichment aims to identify pathways whose *genes* are highly correlated.
Within a group of samples, this approach can help identify pathways whose genes show a high degree of concordance.
For a pathway \(\mathcal{P}\), we compute the correlation between all 
*pairs of genes* belonging to \(\mathcal{P}\), and define the `Correlation Enrichment` 
as the average correlation over all pairs. Values closer to 1 indicate that the genes 
in \(\mathcal{P}\) are tightly correlated; this is the value we plot for each pathway below. 
The p-value measures whether the difference in between the `Correlation Enrichment` and the 
background average correlation among genes is significant.

We split the report according to which database we use to perform the analysis.

## Using KEGG


### Healthy vs Pre-Treatment

#### GSEA

Below we have a GSEA plot computed using the KEGG pathway
database. We're comparing the healthy donor samples to Pre-Treatment samples. 
Red indicates increased activity in Pre-Treatment samples, while blue shows increased activity
in healthy samples. 

```{r, include=TRUE, fig.align="center", fig.cap=c("Healthy vs Pre-Treatment")}
knitr::include_graphics("sig-includedkegg Healthy vs Pre-Treatment-gsea-plot.png")
```

#### Correlation Enrichment

Below we show the correlation enrichment in Healthy samples on the left, 
as well as Pre-Treatment samples on the right. Pathways with higher enrichment score indicate more 
concordance among the genes in that pathway. Note that color does not have any
meaning in correlation enrichment.


```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height = "49%", fig.cap="Left: Healthy - Right: Pre-Treatment",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("sig-included-Kegg Healthy-correlation-enrichment-plot.png",
                          "sig-included-Kegg Pre-Treatment-correlation-enrichment-plot.png"))
```

### Healthy vs Gilteritinib

#### GSEA

Below we have a GSEA plot computed using the KEGG pathway
database. We compare healthy samples to Gilteritinib treated samples.

in healthy samples.
